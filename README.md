## Overview
The **Ticton Oracle Bot** is an arbitrage bot that operates by fetching the average market price of TON/USDT from multiple exchanges. It then quotes this price to the Ticton Oracle. In doing so, it seeks arbitrage opportunities among other quoters. 

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
